### Boots-n-Stuff Online Store

This is an in-depth look at creating an online marketplace.  Since we live in Texas, we used cowboy boots as a product around which to create this marketplace.  The site features an employee area and a customer area.  Authentication is employed via Passport.js and admittance to the employee areas is only allowed for those users with the role of employee or administrator.  Employees can add more products to the database.  Everyone, once creating an account and signing in, can view their profile dashboard and select products for purchase and add to their cart.  

The site uses a SQL database, utilizes Sequelize as an ORM, features authentication with Passport.js, and utilizes the Blurbird npm package for promise chaining.  The database features multiple associated tables and pre-created seeds.  

Future developments for this project include improving picture upload on employee item entry, adding e-mail address authentication with reply required, and purchasing capabilities with credit card.

### Interactive Friend Finder

This project utilizes a SQL database to store friend data (either imaginary or real).  A user interacts with the program by answering a survey and uploading a weblink to a picture of their choosing. The program then queries the database for all entries and compares the user's answers with the answers of all other users.  The program takes this data and shows the current user who their closest match is.

### Hooligan's Web Video Game

This was a group project, where my group designed a fighting-style game where the player plays against a computer.  The page uses Firebase to log in users and stores their information and player attributes.  Players choose a favorite team and strength, stamina, and wits properties and a fighter to play.  

My biggest contribution to the project was implementing authentication with Firebase, storing information in the database, and responding to queries.  I connected this retrieved information to the player UI.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Online Multiplayer Game

The challenge of this project was not the functionality of the RPSLS game itself, but connecting two users and having them play each other over the internet.  The game is connected to a Firebase database and event listeners guide players through the game.  The game also has a real-time chat box.

### Interactive Giphy Finder

The challenge of this project was not only creating a beautiful site but implementing calls to the Giphy API and displaying results and creating an interactive site - users can create buttons of their own to search the Giphy API for whatever word they choose.
