### Hooligan's Web Video Game

This was a group project, where my group designed a fighting-style game where the player plays against a computer.  The page uses Firebase to log in users and stores their information and player attributes.  Players choose a favorite team and strength, stamina, and wits properties and a fighter to play.  

My biggest contribution to the project was implementing authentication with Firebase, storing information in the database, and responding to queries.  I connected this retrieved information to the player UI.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Online Multiplayer Game

The challenge of this project was not the functionality of the RPSLS game itself, but connecting two users and having them play each other over the internet.  The game is connected to a Firebase database and event listeners guide players through the game.  The game also has a real-time chat box.

### Interactive Giphy Finder

The challenge of this project was not only creating a beautiful site but implementing calls to the Giphy API and displaying results and creating an interactive site - users can create buttons of their own to search the Giphy API for whatever word they choose.
